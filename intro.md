# Data Science in Finance (DSIF) with Python

* Intro to DS and the various application within the finances

Main topics:

* Fundamentals

* Datasets
* Data cleaning
* Sample Statistics
* Linear models
* Optimization
* Portfolio construction

$$
\begin{align}
y=a+bx
\end{align}
$$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
